Akita is a computer architecture simulation engine. Like a game engine, a simulator engine is not a simulator, but rather a framework for building simulators. Akita is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy experimentation with new computer architecture design ideas.

Akita documentation is live at https://akitasim.dev/docs/akita/
