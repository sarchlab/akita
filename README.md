Akita is a computer architecture simulation engine. Like a game engine, a simulator engine is not a simulator, but rather a framework for building simulators. Akita is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy experimentation with new computer architecture design ideas.

Akita documentation is live at https://akitasim.dev/docs/akita/

## V5 Development

We are currently developing Akita v5 alongside v4. V5 packages are being added to the v4 codebase for now, and v4 users can safely ignore these packages as they maintain full backward compatibility. For more information about v5 development plans and progress, please refer to [issue #304](https://github.com/sarchlab/akita/issues/304) and the [v5 milestone](https://github.com/sarchlab/akita/milestone).

For migration information between versions, see our [Migration Guide](migration_guide.md).
