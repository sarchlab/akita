# Migration Guide

## Defining Components in V5: Philosophy and Patterns

V5 unifies how components are modeled and wired. Each component is a single struct composed of four orthogonal parts: Spec, State, Ports, and Middlewares. The goals are: declarative configuration, local and serializable runtime state, explicit wiring, testability, and deterministic snapshot/restore.

### Time management

V5 rethinks time management to improve determinism and make scheduling rules explicit.

- **Events as plain structs**: V4 relied on the `sim.Event` interface (`Time()`, `Handler()`, `IsSecondary()`) backed by `EventBase` and floating-point times. V5 replaces that with `timing.ScheduledEvent`, a simple struct containing `Event any`, `Time timing.VTimeInCycle`, and `Handler timing.Handler`. User events stay as plain data; handlers use type switches to interpret them. Secondary flags and embedded IDs are gone—if you scheduled custom `EventBase` types, migrate them to plain struct payloads wrapped in `timing.ScheduledEvent`.

- **Integer cycle timeline**: V4 engines stored timestamps and frequencies as `float64`, which could introduce rounding differences across platforms. V5 represents simulation time exclusively with `timing.VTimeInCycle` (`uint64`) while still exposing `timing.VTimeInSec` for reporting. Any custom arithmetic that previously used floating-point seconds should convert through the helper methods added to the registry.

- **Single event queue**: Timing engines no longer keep a secondary queue. In V4, calling `SimEngine.Schedule` with `IsSecondary=true` deferred work that should only become visible in the next cycle. In V5 the secondary path is gone; engines now execute all events in a single, time-ordered queue. Use explicit scheduling (for example `FreqDomain.NextTick`) when work must land on a later cycle.

- **Frequency registry**: Create a global clock coordination object with `timing.NewFrequencyRegistry()`. Register every domain (`RegisterFrequency`) and keep the returned `*timing.FreqDomain` as the canonical clock descriptor. The registry tracks the least-common multiple of registered domains and exposes `secondsToCycles`/`cyclesToSeconds` to bridge between the integer timeline and human-readable seconds.

- **Domain-driven scheduling**: Components should compute their next execution cycle via `FreqDomain` helpers (`ThisTick`, `NextTick`, `NTicksLater`) before scheduling responses. Do not assume the simulation advances exactly one cycle per event; always request the appropriate tick for the domain.


#### Migrating from V4

1. Remove any reliance on `ScheduledEvent{..., IsSecondary: true}`; schedule follow-up work explicitly using the appropriate domain helper (e.g., `domain.NextTick(engine.CurrentTime())`).
2. Replace float-based time math with `timing.VTimeInCycle`. When converting from seconds, register the relevant domain with a `FrequencyRegistry` and call `registry.secondsToCycles`, or use `FreqDomain.NTicksLater` instead of multiplying by floating-point frequencies.
3. Instantiate a `timing.FrequencyRegistry` (instead of the old planner) and keep returned `*timing.FreqDomain` handles in your components. All existing `FreqDomain` methods remain, only the owner type and constructor names change.
4. Replace custom `sim.Event` implementations with plain payload structs plus `timing.ScheduledEvent` wrappers. Handlers now accept `any` and use type switches; drop `EventBase` inheritance and remove `IsSecondary` logic.
5. Update utility wrappers or static factories that previously returned `EventScheduler` interfaces to reference local interfaces capturing just `Schedule`/`CurrentTime`. V5 no longer exports `Timing.EventScheduler`/`TimeTeller`; define them where needed in your package.

### Component Redesign 

1. Spec (immutable configuration)
   - Describes behavior and dependencies using only primitives (bool, number, string) and primitive maps/slices.
   - Strategy dependencies are expressed as small primitive "sub‑specs" (e.g., `{ Kind: "interleaving", Params: { ... } }`).
   - No pointers or live objects in Spec. Keep it JSON/YAML‑friendly and hashable.
   - Validation and defaults are part of the component package (e.g., `validate()` + `defaults()`).

2. State (mutable runtime data)
   - Pure data only: scalars and slices/maps of primitives or simple structs thereof.
   - No live handles, functions, channels, or ports in State.
   - All cross‑references use stable identifiers (IDs), never in‑memory pointers.
   - Snapshot/restore uses deep copies of State so checkpoints are immutable.

3. Ports (externally injected)
   - Components never construct or own connections. Ports are created/injected during wiring and registered via `AddPort(name, port)`.
   - Components access ports by name via `GetPortByName("...")` to avoid compile‑time coupling.

4. Middlewares (ordered, stateless over the component)
   - Implement the per‑tick pipeline. Each middleware operates on the component’s State and interacts with Ports.
   - Keep middlewares stateless wrt external dependencies; resolve them at build time and pass the resolved handles in.
   - Prefer tick‑driven countdowns/backpressure over ad‑hoc scheduled events for simpler snapshots and determinism.

### Dependency Injection and Shared State

- Strategy injection (e.g., address conversion)
  - Keep in Spec as a primitive descriptor (`Kind`, `Params`), not as a live object.
  - Resolve to concrete implementations locally in the component builder and inject into middlewares.
  - On restore, reconstruct from Spec; never serialize strategy objects.

- Emulation state (e.g., memory storage)
  - Treat as shared state separate from timing logic. Store only an ID (e.g., `StorageRef`) in Spec/State.
  - Keep a per‑simulation state registry; components resolve handles by ID at runtime.
  - Snapshot/restore orchestrates shared state once per ID (outside components); components snapshot only their own State.

### Build and Wire (two stages)

1. Build from Spec
   - `Builder.WithSpec(spec).WithSimulation(sim).Build(name)` constructs the component with defaults and resolved strategies.
   - Do not create or connect ports here.

2. Wire topology
   - Create ports and connections, then inject ports via `AddPort("...", port)`.
   - Use names consistently so components and tooling can introspect topology.

### Determinism and Introspection

- Determinism: avoid non‑deterministic IDs or iteration order; snapshot ID generators; canonicalize map iteration by sorting.
- Introspection: provide methods to inspect effective Spec (with defaults) and to dump State for debugging.
- Tracing/metrics: attach as middlewares or hooks; avoid embedding tracing in business logic.

### Testing and Mocks

- Favor local interfaces inside the component package to reduce external coupling (e.g., `Storage`, `AddressConverter`, `StateAccessor`).
- Generate mocks from local interfaces for unit tests; avoid importing remote mocks.
- Drive behavior via ticks and ports; avoid requiring real engines or networks in unit tests.

### Example: Ideal Memory Controller (V5)

- Spec
  - Timing: `Width`, `LatencyCycles`, `Freq`.
  - Shared emulation: `StorageRef` (ID in simulation state registry).
  - Strategy: `AddrConv` as `{ Kind, Params }` (e.g., identity/interleaving).

- State
  - Pure data transactions with countdowns; no ports or live pointers.
  - Drain/enable mode as a small enum; deep‑copied for snapshots.

- Ports
  - `Top`, `Control` injected during wiring; accessed via name lookups.

- Middlewares
  - Data path: tick‑driven; consumes from `Top`, counts down latency, responds when ready; uses storage resolved via state registry by `StorageRef`.
  - Control path: processes enable/pause/drain; replies only when safe (e.g., after drain completes).

This pattern generalizes to other components: keep Spec primitive and declarative, keep State pure and serializable, inject Ports, and implement behavior as pipelines of middlewares with minimal, explicit dependencies.

## Queueing V5: Elimination of Interface Patterns

The `queueingv5` package provides buffer and pipeline implementations that follow V5 design principles by eliminating the interface/implementation pattern used in the original `sim.Buffer` and `pipelining.Pipeline` interfaces.

### Key Changes from V4 to V5

**V4 Pattern (Interface + Implementation):**
```go
// V4: Interface abstraction with hidden implementation
var buffer sim.Buffer = sim.NewBuffer("name", 10)
var pipeline pipelining.Pipeline = pipelining.MakeBuilder().Build("name")
```

**V5 Pattern (Direct Struct Usage):**
```go
// V5: Direct struct usage, no interfaces
buffer := queueingv5.NewBuffer("name", 10)
pipeline := queueingv5.NewPipelineBuilder().Build("name")
```

### Migration Benefits

1. **Compile-time Type Safety**: Direct struct usage provides better type checking and eliminates interface overhead.

2. **Performance**: Reduced indirection and allocation overhead compared to interface-based implementations.

3. **Simplified APIs**: Cleaner method calls without interface abstraction layers.

4. **Maintained Functionality**: All essential features preserved including:
   - Hook support for simulation tracing
   - FIFO queue behavior with capacity management
   - Multi-stage pipeline processing with configurable timing
   - Integration with existing `sim.HookableBase` and tracing systems

### Usage Examples

**Buffer Migration:**
```go
// V4
buffer := sim.NewBuffer("MyBuffer", 100)

// V5
buffer := queueingv5.NewBuffer("MyBuffer", 100)
```

**Pipeline Migration:**
```go
// V4
pipeline := pipelining.MakeBuilder().
    WithNumStage(5).
    WithCyclePerStage(2).
    WithPostPipelineBuffer(postBuf).
    Build("MyPipeline")

// V5
pipeline := queueingv5.NewPipelineBuilder().
    WithNumStage(5).
    WithCyclePerStage(2).
    WithPostPipelineBuffer(postBuf).
    Build("MyPipeline")
```

### V5 Component Integration

When building V5 components, use `queueingv5` structs directly in your component State:

```go
type MyComponentState struct {
    InputBuffer  *queueingv5.Buffer
    Pipeline     *queueingv5.Pipeline
    OutputBuffer *queueingv5.Buffer
}
```
